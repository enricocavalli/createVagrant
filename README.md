This script, adapted form https://gist.github.com/mmarseglia/6d4cfe2f0c7e6f582323,
creates a Vagrant environment with puppet and r10k

Prerequisites:

 * git (of course)
 *  vagrant r10k plugin (`vagrant plugin install vagrant-r10k`)
 
 
 Some basic hiera and and a class example is created, to remind (me) the basic usage of puppet with vagrant
